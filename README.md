# odin-recipes
This is a website that includes a home page that links to three of my favourite recipes. Each recipe page contains an image, a list of ingredients and step by step explanation on how to create the recipe.\

This project demonstrates my ability to create an organized file structure, create a valid html boilerplate and use html elements such as headers, ordered/unordered lists, images and links.
